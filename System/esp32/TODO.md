# Aquarius+ to do

- ESP32
  - Overlay menu
    - Improve drawMessage to allow for multiple lines of text
    - Hand controller emulation
    - Confirmation before factory reset
  - Bluetooth
    - Bug: Bluetooth forgets bonding (Sean)
- FPGA
  - FIFO based sample playback

Remarks Sean:

- I wouldn't mind seeing the clock speed on the main screen at the top, but it's a thought, not a deal-breaker.
