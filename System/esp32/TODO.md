# Aquarius+ to do

- ESP32
  - Overlay menu
    - Improve drawMessage to allow for multiple lines of text
    - Hand controller emulation
  - Bluetooth
    - BLE keyboard support
    - Bug: Bluetooth forgets bonding (Sean)
- FPGA
  - FIFO based sample playback
  - Port AQMS to new structure

Remarks Sean:

- I wouldn't mind seeing the clock speed on the main screen at the top, but it's a thought, not a deal-breaker.
- "Use external Z80" may be confusing for some (external to what?), and it may suggest that users without a Z80 have the option to magically have one. If the Pin 50 is low, can that option be dimmed?
